An app idea I have is a todo list app with a points system. Users can add
items to the list, and each item can have sub-items. Completing items will
earn the user points. Users can add soft and hard deadlines for tasks.
Completing tasks early will score more points, and tasks completed after
the deadline will be penalized. A streak system will keep track of the
number of tasks that the user has fulfilled without missing deadlines. A
graph can show the score overtime similar to credit scores. The app will
help users plan our their time and set reasonable deadlines.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

An error occurred when trying to download the simulators within Xcode.
A solution I found on the internet was to manually download the simulators
from Apple's website and import with a command. Fortunately, the solution
worked, and I was able to build and test the app.
